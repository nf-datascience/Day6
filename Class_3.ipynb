    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter. Before you do, think about what you expect the output to be, and make sure your intuition matches up with what you run. If it doesn't, take some time to think about what happened so you can hone your intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test code by running it; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",

    "##### Defining other methods \n",
    "\n",
    "What if we want to make classes with these method things that allow us to access and manipulate the a class' attributes? \n",
    "\n",
    "Defining other methods is going to work exactly like defining the `__init__()` method (except we won't begin or end their names with double underscores, **unless** they are magic methods, which we'll get to). The only difference is in how we access those methods from outside of our object. Whereas the `__init__()` method is called by default when we instantiate an object, we are going to have to explicitly call other methods (that aren't **magic methods**) after the instantiation of the object. Again, we'll call those other methods via dot notation. Let's take a look at defining another method within `OurClass()`. \n"

    "Here, we have now defined another method within our class, `add_question_asked()`. Notice that we call this method *after* we have instantiated an instance of `OurClass()` (stored in the variable `our_class`), and we use dot notation to access it. This `add_question_asked()` method takes in a string (or really anything) and appends it to the object's `questions_asked` attribute. But, how does it know where to find the `questions_asked` attribute if it isn't passed into the `add_question_asked` method? This comes back to the beauty of the `self` reference that is *automatically* passed as the first argument in any method call on an object. That `self` reference holds access to *any* of the object's attributes, no matter where they were defined (in the `__init__()`, in another method, etc.). *As long as* that attribute was assigned via dot notation using `self`, then it will be accessible via `self` in any method of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, too, that any method within the class can alter the attributes that are accessible via `self`. Above, we used the `add_question_asked` method to alter the `questions_asked` attribute. However, if we use a variable within a method and don't assign it as a class attribute, then it won't be accessible in other methods of the class (this is because it will be enclosed in the scope of that method only). Let's hammer this home with another example. "

    "Let's highlight a couple of things in our last example here. The main point of this example is to show that any method can access any attribute of the class **that is assigned via `self`**. A variable not assigned via `self.<variable name>` is not an attribute. We see this in two of our methods above - `add_question_asked()` is able to access the `questions_asked` attribute (just as before), and `add_class_members()` is able to access `size`. Both of these attributes are accessed via `self`. When we get to `check_if_at_capacity()`, though, it tries to access `at_capacity`, which was never made an attribute (assigned via `self`), and hence not available via `self`. The way this code is written, `at_capacity` is only ever set and accessible within the `add_class_members()` method itself. Let's fix this by assigning it via `self` and seeing what that does. "
