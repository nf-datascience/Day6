    "# Introductory Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter. Before you do, think about what you expect the output to be, and make sure your intuition matches up with what you run. If it doesn't, take some time to think about what happened so you can hone your intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test code by running it; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to actually learning how to build a class, it'll be helpful to define some of the terminology surrounding classes/OOP. Often times, the terminology can be the most confusing part of learning OOP. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class** - Used to refer to the abstract concept of an object.\n",
    "2. **Object** - An actual instance of a class.\n",
    "3. **Instance** - What Python returns when you tell it to create a class.\n",
    "4. **Instantiation** - A fancy way of saying that we're going to create an instance of a class. \n",
    "5. **Constructor** - What we call to instantiate a class. \n",
    "6. **self** - Inside of a class, a variable for the instance/object being accessed (i.e. it holds a reference to the instance/object of that class).\n",
    "7. **attribute**/**field**/**property** - A piece of data that a class has, stored in a variable. Inside of a class definition, all attributes/fields/properties are accessed via `self.<attribute>`, while on an instance, they are accessed via `<variable name>.<attribute>`.\n",
    "8. **method**/**procedure** - A block of code that is accessible via the class, and typically acts on or with the classes' attributes/fields/properties. Inside of a class definition, all methods/procedures are created via `def` (they are really just functions), and accessible via `self.<method>()`, while on an instance, they are accessed via `<variable name>.<method>()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if this terminology isn't 100% clear at this point in time. It should become more clear as we work through these notes, and should be a useful reference. From here on out, we'll treat attribute, field, and property as interchangeable, and we'll do the same with method and procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like defining a function, there is specific syntax used to define a class. It is almost exactly the same as defining a function, but we replace `def` with `class`. That is, we write `class`, then the name of the class that we are defining, followed by a set of parentheses, and finally a colon. After the colon is an indented block of code that we use to define the class attributes and methods. One subtle difference is that with functions, the standard is to name these beginning in lowercase and separating words with underscores (i.e. *snake_case*); with classes, the standard is to name these capitalized, and not separate words at all (i.e. *CamelCase*). For example...\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "class OurClass(): \n",
    "    # attributes and methods go in here.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: As we'll show below, `OurClass()` is exactly what we'd used to create an instance of this class, and is the **constructor** for this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instantiation \n",
    "\n",
    "Like we mentioned above, **instantiation** is just a fancy word for saying that we're going to create an instance of a particular class. We do this by calling the **constructor** for our class, which is the name that we give our class right after the `class` statement in its definition. Using this **constructor**, we create an instance of our class, and store that instance in a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "our_class = OurClass() \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, cool! Let's revisit some of the terminology that we discussed above. We've shown you how to define a class, and **instantiate** it using a **constructor**. What we've done directly above is created an **instance** of `OurClass` that we've stored in the `our_class` variable. This variable is a reference to an object that theoretically has **attributes** and **methods**, which we can use to interact with it (we say theoretically because we didn't actually define any attributes or methods above). Now let's look at how to actually build a class that does something. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inner Workings (defining attributes and methods) \n",
    "\n",
    "As review, remember that inside of a class, we can have both attributes and methods. We can then think of these attributes and methods as belonging to the class, and they become accessible via any instances of the class (through dot notation, which we'll get to in a second). Inside of the class, all of these attributes and methods are set and retrieved via `self`. Let's dive in...\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The `__init__()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every class you ever write will have an `__init__()` method. This method gets called every time that you create a new instance of a class, and handles any kind of setup that the class may require. Setup typically just involves assigning values to attributes, which we can do with or without values passed in (similar to how we interact with functions). Let's look at defining a class and instantiating a class in both of these cases. "

    "How does the `__init__()` method work? As mentioned above, it is called by default whenever we instantiate an instance of `OurClass()` (or whatever class it is a part of). In addition, any arguments that we pass to the `OurClass()` constructor that we use during instantiation are passed to the `__init__()` method. But wait... In the `__init__()` method definition you have it accepting the `self` parameter, but don't pass any arguments during instantiation? The reason for this is that by default, Python passes a reference to the instance (which is what `self` is) as the first argument in any method that is defined within the class. Let's dive into this a little deeper...   \n",
    "\n",
    "`self` is what we use inside of the class to access attributes or methods of the class. Notice that we do this with dot notation - e.g. by placing a period after `self`, and then the name of the attribute or method that we want to access. When we write `self.name = 'Intro Python'`, then, what we are doing is accessing `self.name` and then assigning it the value of 'Intro Python'. Outside of the class, we access this attribute (or any attribute/method) again via dot notation, but replacing `self` with the variable name that holds a reference to our instantiated object (above this is `our_class`).

    "So, what's happening here? In our `__init__()` method, we have included another parameter in addition to `self`. In doing so, when we instantiate our class, the constructor expects an argument (in addition to `self`, which is automatically passed by default). It then takes that expected argument and assigns it to the `name` attribute. Then, we access that `name` attribute via dot notation, prefaced with  `self` inside of the class and the variable name of your object outside of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happened in that last example, though? Here, we tried to instantiate the class without an argument and got an error. This is because we didn't pass in an argument for the `name` parameter. Methods within classes work exactly like functions (in fact they are functions, we just call them methods since they are inside classes). As a result, we have to pass the expected number of arguments in when we call them (with the caveat that `self` is passed by default, and that `__init__()` is called by default when a class is instantiated).\n",
